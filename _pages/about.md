Welcome to my website! Here you can find links to my social medias, <a href="https://danywaller.github.io/files/CV.pdf" download="Waller_CV.pdf">CV</a>, and fun visualizations I make.

I'm currently a PhD student at Umeå University working with Dr. Shahab Fatemi on Hermean magnetosphere dynamics and lunar crustal magnetic anomalies. 

My interests are magnetic fields throughout the solar system: how to measure them, how to model them, and how to visualize them.

I'm a big fan of data fusion, especially coupling observations and models together to understand near-surface structures and surface expression of space weathering.
