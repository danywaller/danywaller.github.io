Welcome to my website! Here you can find links to my social medias, <a href="https://danywaller.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" download="Waller_CV.pdf">CV</a>, and fun visualizations I make.

I'm currently a PhD student at Umeå University working with Dr. Shahab Fatemi on Hermean magnetosphere dynamics and lunar magnetic anomalies. 
My interests are electromagnetic fields in almost every form throughout the solar system. 
I like data fusion and coupling models together to understand near-surface structures and surface expression of space weathering.
